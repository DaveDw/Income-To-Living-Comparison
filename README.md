### The Re-Tail Store

## Group 4: David Dwight, Sam Patel, Adam McLane, Brandon Cheung

## Obejective:
Use TheDogAPI and Petfinder API to lookup breeds of dogs, and then determine if those breeds are available for adoption in the area.

## User Story:

1. As a user, I want to be able to search up different breeds of dogs by pictures.
2. As a user, upon clicking on a picture, I am redirected to available dogs up for adoption in the area.

## Wireframe:
TBD

## Steps to Accomplish the Project:
* Get approval of APIs
* Create GitHub Repo with branches/contributors
* Determine most important functionality and necessary data
* We want to have a collection of pictures for differing breeds of dogs where when the user clicks a particular picture, the user is then redirected to a list of available adoption centers for which that particular breed is available for adoption.
* Determine layout of page
