# Income-To-Living-Comparison
Project Proposal Brief


Project Proposal Brief: Income to Living Comparison
Group 4: David Dwight, Sam Patel, Adam McLane, Brandon Cheung

Use Zillow API and Glassdoor API to determine what area of housing (Philadelphia County) you qualify for based on the expected salary of the jobs you’re looking for (e.g. software engineer, web designer, etc..)

As a user, I want to find neighborhoods that I can afford to live in based on the salary I am being paid/seeking.

As a user, I am looking at 1-2 bedroom apartments in Philadelphia County.

User input can be accepted as either the income that the user has or the profession that the user wants (depending on whichever is better suited with the APIs that we found). This will show the top neighborhoods that having that income they can rent for a 1 bedroom apartment.  

Steps to Accomplish the Project:
Get approval of APIs
Create GitHub Repo with branches/contributors
Determine most important functionality and necessary data
We want it to take input salary, apply tax, divide by 3 (taking into account that you have to provide first month, last month, and security deposit) to determine an acceptable rent range, and then compare the average rent of 1-2br apt in the neighborhood to the rent range.
Determine layout of page
Glam it up. Add lemon chiffon.
Get API’s to page and start to pull data
Work with API’s to pull neighborhoods based on job selected
