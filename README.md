# dog-breed-finder
### Project Proposal Brief


### Project Proposal Brief: The Re-Tail Store
## Group 4: David Dwight, Sam Patel, Adam McLane, Brandon Cheung

Use PetFinder API and TheDogAPI to look up dogs that are available for adoption.

As a user, I want to be able to search up different breeds of dogs by pictures.

As a user, upon clicking on a picture, I am redirected to available dogs up for adoption in the area.


## Steps to Accomplish the Project:
* Get approval of APIs
* Create GitHub Repo with branches/contributors
* Determine most important functionality and necessary data
* We want to have a collection of pictures for differing breeds of dogs where when the user clicks a particular picture, the user is then redirected to a list of available adoption centers for which that particular breed is available for adoption.
* Determine layout of page
* Glam it up. Add lemon chiffon.
* Get API’s to page and start to pull data
* Work with API’s to pull neighborhoods based on job selected
