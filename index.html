        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>There are roughly 3.3 million dogs that are up for adoption each year. Many of these furry friends are unable
            to find a home or anyone to take them in. Dog ownership has rose around 39% in the past 10 years and it
            continues to increase now.</p>

            <p>The Re-Tail Store is a website that helps users want to find a furry friend up for adoption. It is organized
            in a way that provides convenience to the user. All that needs to be done is you type in a particular dog
            breed of interest and then you are provided a list of images of dogs that are available in the surrounding
            area of where you are located. Once you find a furry friend that you may be interested in adopting, you just
            click the image of the dog and you are then redirected to locations where your dog breed of interest may be
            available for adoption.</p>
